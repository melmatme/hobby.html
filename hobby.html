    <h6>A Brief Histoy of Lucky Stars/Origami Stars!</h6>
        <p>There is a Japanese folklore about a little girl named Hoshi that Hoshi loved stargazing and admiring the stars in the night sky. While stargazing, she wondered how stars could shine so brightly in the sky. 
            One night, she saw the stars falling in a meteor shower and was saddened that the stars had fallen.
            Because she wanted to keep the stars from falling, she had begun to fold paper stars for every star she saw fall out of the sky. That night, she had folded over a hundred paper stars.
            The next day, there were only a few stars in the sky, so in a hurry, she ran to each home in the village and gathered more children to help her fold paper stars. They ended up making about two thousand stars, placing their stars in their own jars.
            After folding so many stars, Hoshi and the children saw that the night sky was filled with stars the following day.

    <h8>Continuation</h8>
        <p>Origami is a paper folding craft that originated in Japan. Originally known as oritaka, the word is derived from two other Japanese words: ori meaning “folding” and kami meaning “paper.
            During the early stages of origami, paper was more expensive and thus the craft was limited to the privileged class for religious and formal ceremonies.
            In 1603, origami became more widespread in Japan due to the low costs of washi paper.
            Origami paper stars are generally given as gifts to loved ones to symbolize good luck, love, and support. They also signify admiration and love for the recipient of the stars.
